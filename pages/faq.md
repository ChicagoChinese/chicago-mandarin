# FAQ

## What level do I need to be at?

Imagine you are at a friend's party and meet someone for the first time. You would probably introduce yourself and as you're chatting you might mention where you're from, what you do for a living, where you live, your interests, your hobbies, etc. If you can freely discuss all of those things in Mandarin, then you should be fine.

## What do you mean by "immersive language environment"?

It means we'll do our best to stay in Mandarin, and not just resort to English when we can't come up with the exact word or expression. For the sake of practice and learning, it's better to struggle through the hard parts rather than falling back on our native language. There will always be someone around to help you figure out how to say what you're trying to say.
