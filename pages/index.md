# Chicago Mandarin Conversation Meetup

This is a meetup for people who want to practice their spoken Chinese (Mandarin) in an English-free environment. We may eat out, do a potluck, or just get together to chat, but the focus will be on having an immersive language environment.

Native speakers––we heartily welcome you! Please consider joining to help us improve our Mandarin. Maybe you'll be able to find a language exchange partner!

If you haven't mastered basic conversation skills yet, please check out this [meetup open to Chinese learners of all levels](https://www.meetup.com/chicago-chinese/).
